/*
    Time Complexity: O((m - n + 1) * n) â‰ˆ O(m * n)
    - The outer loop runs (m - n + 1) times, and the 'substring' and 'equals' methods compare up to 'n' characters.
    - Therefore, in the worst case, the time complexity is O(m * n), where 'm' is the length of haystack and 'n' is the length of needle.

    Space Complexity: O(1)
    - The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space except for a few variables.
